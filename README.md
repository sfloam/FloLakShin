Instructions for contributions:

  1) When contributing, the default branch is the Development Branch. Do your initial work here.

  2) When finished, push your work from Development onto the Quality-Assurance Branch for testing. If testing goes as plan, submit a request to push onto the master. Never do work directly on the master.

  3) To keep Quality Assurance up to date, regularly PULL from master onto Quality Assurance BEFORE pushing from Development onto Quality-Assurance. This will ensure that your development work will 100% match what is going onto the master.

  4) To keep Development upto date, regularly PULL from master onto Development.
