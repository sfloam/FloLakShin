        Topic: Correlate static data accumulated by the EPA pertaining to NYC to identify areas with the highets level of pollution
               Then. use that data do identify commonalities between those areas (i.e. processes for handling/releasing waste, street 
               structures, etc.) that may be causing these extreme levels of waste. Using the GPS locations of the highest offenders and 
               public repositories of addresses, we will cross reference this data to find a pattern.
               
         Sources of Data: EPA EIS, Google Maps API.
